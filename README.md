# BasicTeams

A basic Minecraft teams plugin for spigot.

I currently know that the plugin works on:
- 1.21
- 1.21.1

## Commands:

- /teams create --Creates a new team
- /teams list --Lists all teams and the players in the teams
- /teams invite [player] --Invite someone to your team
- /teams invites --List all the invites you have
- /teams join [team] --Join a team
- /teams leave --Leave your team

### Only operators can execute:

- /teams teamSize [limit] --Set the max amount of players that can be in a team
- /teams disband [team] --Disband a team
- /teams disbandAll --Disband all teams
- /teams forceJoin [player] [team] --Force a player into a team (add "true" at the end if you want it to ignore the team limit)

- /teams enabled [True | False] --Enable and Disable the plugin

Please let me know if there are any problems!
